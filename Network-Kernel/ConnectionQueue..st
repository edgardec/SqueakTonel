"
A ConnectionQueue listens on a given port number and collects a queue of client connections. In order to handle state changes quickly, a ConnectionQueue has its own process that: (a) tries to keep a socket listening on the port whenever the queue isn't already full of connections and (b) prunes stale connections out of the queue to make room for fresh ones.

The portNumber can be initialized to a collection, in which case all ports will be probed to create a listening socket. Once successfull, the portNumber is set to the chosen port.
