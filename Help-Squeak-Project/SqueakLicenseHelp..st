Copyright FAQ

  1. I don''t understand the resale restrictionâ€¦ What gives?

    Bitstream is giving away these fonts, but wishes to ensure its
    competitors can''t just drop the fonts as is into a font sale system
    and sell them as is. It seems fair that if Bitstream can''t make money
    from the Bitstream Vera fonts, their competitors should not be able to
    do so either. You can sell the fonts as part of any software package,
    however.

  2. I want to package these fonts separately for distribution and
    sale as part of a larger software package or system.  Can I do so?

    Yes. A RPM or Debian package is a "larger software package" to begin
    with, and you aren''t selling them independently by themselves.
    See 1. above.

  3. Are derivative works allowed?
    Yes!!

  4. Can I change or add to the font(s)?
    Yes, but you must change the name(s) of the font(s).

  5. Under what terms are derivative works allowed?

    You must change the name(s) of the fonts. This is to ensure the
    quality of the fonts, both to protect Bitstream and Gnome. We want to
    ensure that if an application has opened a font specifically of these
    names, it gets what it expects (though of course, using fontconfig,
    substitutions could still could have occurred during font
    opening). You must include the Bitstream copyright. Additional
    copyrights can be added, as per copyright law. Happy Font Hacking!!

  6. If I have improvements for Bitstream Vera, is it possible they might get
    adopted in future versions?

    Yes. The contract between the Gnome Foundation and Bitstream has
    provisions for working with Bitstream to ensure quality additions to
    the Bitstream Vera font family. Please contact us if you have such
    additions. Note, that in general, we will want such additions for the
    entire family, not just a single font, and that you''ll have to keep
    both Gnome and Jim Lyles, Vera''s designer, happy!! To make sense to add
    glyphs to the font, they must be stylistically in keeping with Vera''s
    design. Vera cannot become a "ransom note" font. Jim Lyles will be
    providing a document describing the design elements used in Vera, as a
    guide and aid for people interested in contributing to Vera.

  7. I want to sell a software package that uses these fonts: Can I do so?

    Sure. Bundle the fonts with your software and sell your software
    with the fonts. That is the intent of the copyright.

  8. If applications have built the names "Bitstream Vera" into them,
    can I override this somehow to use fonts of my choosing?

    This depends on exact details of the software. Most open source
    systems and software (e.g., Gnome, KDE, etc.) are now converting to
    use fontconfig (see www.fontconfig.org) to handle font configuration,
    selection and substitution; it has provisions for overriding font
    names and subsituting alternatives. An example is provided by the
    supplied local.conf file, which chooses the family Bitstream Vera for
    "sans", "serif" and "monospace".  Other software (e.g., the XFree86
    core server) has other mechanisms for font substitution.

'On 23 September 1996, Apple Computer Inc. released Squeak V1.1 under the "Squeak License" (SqL).

On May 8, 2006 Apple agreed to relicense original Squeak V1.1 under the Apple Public Source License.

On October 12, 2006 Apple granted permission to relicense under Apache license 2.0.

In 2006, VPRI began to collect "Distribution Agreements" for all contributors to Squeak since V1.1 up to V3.8, asking them to relicense their contributions, which were originally licensed under SqL, to the MIT license. This was a great effort on behalf of many and VPRI has 100s of signed documents agreeing to this.

Do you want to contribute source to Squeak? All new contributions since 4.0 must be under the MIT license. When you make your code available, please state explicitly in some form such as the description on a web site or email announcement that your contribution is under the MIT license. (It doesn''t have to be exclusive; you can release it under difference licenses at the same time.)

Have you contributed source to Squeak? If you believe you have, but have not sent in an agreement to allow your submission(s) to be licensed under the MIT license then please see http://netjam.org/squeak/contributors. There you can find a list of known contributors and a PDF of the agreement with instructions. The snail mail address is found in the agreement PDF file.

Also there are a few people for which we are lacking full contact information. If you think you can help please also visit the link above and see if you can identify any of the unknown developer initials or any of the developers for whom we do not have a current email address.!

'Squeak provides several resources (such as icons or sounds) that may come with an extra license if the MIT license does not cover the particular artistic work. If such resources are materialized in source code (such as MenuIcons class >> #fugueBroomIconContents), we note the particular license in method comments.

In general, we are eager to only use extra licenses that share the spirit of the MIT license. Creative Commons falls in this category. Visit https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/ to learn more.!
